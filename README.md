This is a Gosu game called Diver_Man.

If you do not have Gosu, you need to get [gosu](https://www.libgosu.org/). Run the main.rb file, and the game should work.

You will aloso need to get [Trollop](http://trollop.rubyforge.org/), which is just a rubygem. Run `gem install trollop`, and it should work.
